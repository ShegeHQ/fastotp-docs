You'll need to authenticate your requests to access all the endpoints on the Fastotp API. In this guide, we'll look at how authentication works.

## API key

When requesting resources, you will need your API key â€” you will find it in the [Dashboard](https://fastotp.co/dashboard). Here's how to add the key to the request header using cURL:

```bash
curl https://api.fastotp.co/... \
  -H "X-api-key: fastotp_xxx"
```

Always keep your workspace API key safe and reset it if you suspect it has been compromised.
